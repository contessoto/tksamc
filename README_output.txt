The results folder contains the files and figures generated by the TKSA-MC software which are the following:

- Fig_MC_*name_of_pdb*_pH_*_T_*.jpg: Figure of electrostatic free energy per residue. Red bars indicate positive (unfavorable) values, blue bars indicate negative (favorable) values.

- Output_MC_*name_of_pdb*_pH_*_T_*.csv: Information used for algorithm obtained from the PDB file and calculation results.
There are 13 columns in this file:
1 - Name:           3 letters code used to identify the residue.
2 - Residue-index:  Residue sequence position in the PDB file.
3 - Position:       Ionizable residue index position (internal counter).
4 - Atom-Index:     Atom serial number in the PDB file.
5 - Atom-type:      Identification of the atom assumed as the ionizable group (e.g., NZ, OE2).
6 - X:              Position X of the atom in the PDB file in Angstroms.
7 - Y:              Position Y of the atom in the PDB file in Angstroms.
8 - Z:              Position Z of the atom in the PDB file in Angstroms.
9 - PKA:            Value of the reference PKA for each residue type.
10 - SASA:          Normalized Solvent-Accessible Surface Area - calculated using MDTraj (Shrake-Rupley algorithm) and normalized by reference values. The reference max area is chosen via the -aref flag (default: header values, using legacy constants; option: mdtraj, using Tien et al. 2013 Bondi values).
11 - Charge:        Initial charge assumed to start the algorithm.
12 - dG_Energy:     Free energy contribution of each residue in kJ/mol.
13 - Total_dG:      Electrostatic free energy contribution of all residues (Summation of column 12) in kJ/mol.
